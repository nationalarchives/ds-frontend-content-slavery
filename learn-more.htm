			<p>On 5 December 1677 the Royal African Company ship the <em>Arthur</em> set sail from Gravesend bound for Calabar in Nigeria to buy Africans to sell in Barbados. George Hingston, the company’s agent for this voyage kept a journal of the journey. The diary describes the voyage from Gravesend in Kent through the Thames Estuary to the West Coast of Africa via Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands. </p>
			
			<p>The <em>Arthur</em> arrived in New Calabar River in the Niger Delta on 10 February 1678. George Hingston started trading with local African kings to buy Africans for an agreed price of 36 copper bars for men and 30 copper bars for women. Between 12 February and 18 March 1678, when the <em>Arthur</em> left the river, Hingston had bought 348 Africans. The first slave death (of an unnamed African woman) occurred at about 4pm on 3 March; a seaman had already died earlier that same day. A further 18 Africans were to die even before the ship set sail for Barbados on 28 March.</p> 
			
			<p>The captives would have experienced great trauma and poor treatment during their capture, in the journey to the coast and subsequent imprisonment in slave traders’ villages and forts prior to being sold and placed on board the <em>Arthur</em>.  For many, the inhumane conditions of their captivity on board during the Middle Passage was too much to bear. 83 Africans died in total (almost one quarter of the total bought); including three people who died after the ship arrived in Barbados on 22 May. This transatlantic voyage had taken almost two months. </p>
			
			<p>For the first time this journal (reference <a href="http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details/C1248197" class="catalogue-link" title="View The National Archives' catalogue">T 70/1213)</a>has been digitised and is available for free download.</p>
				
			<p>You can <a href="/slavery/pdf/Arthur_Transcript.pdf" target="_blank" title="Download this document - opens in a new window">download a free transcription of the journal</a> (<abbr title="Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, 206kb), kindly prepared by Mike Breward of the University of the West of England. We have also produced a <a href="/slavery/pdf/Arthur_Translation.pdf" target="_blank" title="Download this document - opens in a new window">modern translation</a> (<abbr title="Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, 179kb) to help read and understand the journal, although the language and phrasing has not been changed. </p>
			
			<p>This <a href="/pathways/blackhistory/africa_caribbean/docs/map_forts.htm">map of West Africa from the same time period</a> (<a href="/catalogue/ExternalRequest.asp?RequestReference=MPG1/221" class="catalogue-link" title="View The National Archives Catalogue">MPG 1/221</a>) shows many of the locations mentioned in the journal.</p>
			<p>Contemporary with the <em>Arthur</em>’s journal is the diary of Jean Barbot (<a href="/catalogue/ExternalRequest.asp?RequestReference=ADM7/830A" class="catalogue-link" title="View The National Archives Catalogue">ADM 7/830A</a> and <a href="/catalogue/ExternalRequest.asp?RequestReference=ADM7/830B" class="catalogue-link" title="View The National Archives Catalogue">ADM 7/830B</a>), a French explorer who describes the people, language, environment, fauna and flora experienced during his time in West Africa. It is highly illustrative and Hingston and the crew of the <em>Arthur</em> may have witnessed similar scenes to Barbot. Could the scene of <a href="/pathways/blackhistory/africa_caribbean/docs/chiefs_europeans.htm">Barbot’s interview with the King of Sestro</a> be similar to Hingston’s meeting with the King of New Calabar or with Donus and Bandy? </p>
